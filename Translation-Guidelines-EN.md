###PURPOSE AND FOCUS OF TRANSLATION
The purpose of this work is to provide an accurate translation of the official release version of the Holacracy Constitution 5.0 available at http://holacracy.org/constitution/5, and **NOT** to translate the <a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/blob/master/Holacracy-Constitution.md">development version of the Holacracy Constitution</a> hosted on GitHub.

The Constitution itself is accompanied by other supporting documents (e.g. the Constitution Adoption Declaration) that are all available on GitHub at https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution

To sum up, the source documents to translate are the following:
* The Holacracy Constitution itself: http://holacracy.org/constitution/5
* All other supporting documents: https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution

###TRANSLATION PROCESS
Each target language has a **Translation Steward** with final authority to accept or reject translation updates. Other contributors may submit changes by *committing* them to the repository, and the Translation Steward will accept or reject the changes.

If you believe another person would clearly be a better fit to be Translation Steward for a target language (including yourself), please <a href="http://holacracy.org/contact" target="_blank">contact HolacracyOne</a>.
